                There are 5 guiding principles governing how all relationships
                within the organization and with its stakeholders (patients,
                doctors, suppliers, bankers, etc.) should be approached:
              </p>
              <ul className="list">
                <li className="guiding_text_sm">
                  Trust: Mutual and unconditional trust are important in the
                  development and maintenance of relationships, be it business
                  or personal.
                </li>
                <li className="guiding_text_sm">
                  Transparency: Decisions are to be made without any hidden
                  agenda. The whyâ€™s of any actions should always readily be
                  available for concerned parties to see.
                </li>
                <li className="guiding_text_sm">
                  Mutual Respect: It is important to respect the individual for
                  what he/she is and not to have prejudices of any type towards
                  anyone.
                </li>
                <li className="guiding_text_sm">
                  Win / Win: Dealings within relationships ought to be
                  approached from a position of considering the optimal outcome
                  for both parties.
                </li>
                <li className="guiding_text_sm">
                  Long Term Commitment: For any effective relationships to be
                  built, it requires time.
                </li>
              </ul>
